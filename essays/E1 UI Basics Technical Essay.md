WODs 1 through 3 were a little rough.

On my first attempt of Browserhistory1, I didn't complete the WOD because I forgot how to link website, web page sections, and images to a web page. I tried to link things to their respective places, but I was unable complete the WOD under DNF time. After re-reading the CSS Dog HTML tutorial and watching the screencast, I started my second attempt. I got it under the DNF time, but I my time in the SD range. I reviewed the material again, and started my third attempt. On my third attempt, I got my time in the Average range. My main weaknesses for this WOD were centered around not understanding what each elements can and cannot do. I tried to link the images into the the document using href rather src; I thought I linked the sections to the table of contents correctly, but I link the sections in the li element instead of <a> which made me wonder why my text wasn't clickable. Most of the time I was making dumb typing mistakes.

For Browserhistory2, I skipped the steps that said to change the font because I didn't know if the fonts were native of they weren't loading in my browser. I completed every step and tried to figure out why the fonts weren't loading. I stopped my timer and referred back to the articles in the module to see what I missed. I was missing the link to the google fonts in my html file. I watched the screencast to see how to link the fonts  to my document. I started up my second attempt and got a time of Avg because I was checking my code and tweaking it to what was wrong. Some errors on my end are forgetting capitalize letters. I scrapped my second attempt and went on to my third attempt. I got an Avg time better than my second attempt. For this WOD, I was so confused when it said "text width should be 950px". I thought it meant like the text itself, but I came to realize it just meant like limit of the text until it moves to the next line. 

Browserhistory3 was fun to do because I was testing different codes for alignment. My main problem was figuring out how to use div and class. I knew I had to use div to make the the columns of text. Changing it in the CSS was a problem during my first few attempts because I didn't give the each div a class. For the navigation bar, I didn't know how to hide the bullet points my first attempt. I referred to the screencast to see what I was missing in my CSS. On my 2nd and 3rd attempts, I tested different codes to align the columns and the navigation bar. 

Overall, I'm getting comfortable with html and css. I need to review and practice more to be more speedy. Always remember that when in doubt, refer to the readings and other sources to get practice, like W3Schools.
