Turning in Assignment 1 was a big stress for me to complete because of my sleepiness in the morning. \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 From the beginning of the course to the current day, I feel that my understanding of programming is above average. Generally speaking, my understanding of what works and does not work is at an okay level. There aren\'92t any specific aspects of programming that I would say that I have greatly improved in, but I\'92ve gained a better grasp of programming.\'a0\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Overall, I need to improve my technical skills. I tend to get a bit irritated when I try something and it doesn\'92t work. I refer to too many videos on youtube for help, but I feel that starting on a black slate and just doing what I\'92m having trouble with will help me. Like server side processing and implementation of code in an HTML page. I struggle with assignment1, and I\'92m still struggling with understanding algorithms.\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I attempt the WODs without looking at the screencasts because that\'92ll take away the learning aspect for me. The first run will always be the longest run because I over complicate the direction and try other ways to get the same result. After trying various things, I do my subsequent runs to see if I can complete it without the screencast. I refer to the screencasts before I start an attempt for the WOD I\'92m going to turn in.\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The labs have really helped me with being able to think through solutions and understand why things work. I get confused with some direction in the labs, but I believe that it\'92s due to my lack of practice and reading the manual.\'a0\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 As of now, I am not so confident that I am ready for the next step because I struggled with assignment1 and barely got it to work properly. I refer to many videos and the tutorial links. I would say that I\'92m behind on learning what I need to learn, but I believe that I can get through the next assignment at a very basic level.\'a0\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I think that simple, in-depth explanation videos with follow along coding would help me get a firmer grasp on things like node and server side things will help. I try to find resources on youtube, like freeCodeCamp and others, for explanations, but they tend to explain things that get a little complicated to understand.\'a0\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The screencasts really help with my learning because I\'92m not fully paying attention in the morning. After the class, I can review the screencasts on parts that I didn\'92t understand and take my time to try the code and do different things with it to see how it would respond.\uc0\u8232 \cb1 \
