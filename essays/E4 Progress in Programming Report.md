My sleepiness in the morning is the cause of my lack for major progress. 
1. From the beginning of the course to the current day, I feel that my understanding of programming is above average. Generally speaking, my understanding of what works and does not work is at an okay level. There aren’t any specific aspects of programming that I would say that I have greatly improved in, but I’ve gained a better grasp of programming.

2. Overall, I need to improve my technical skills. I tend to get a bit irritated when I try something and it doesn’t work. I refer to too many videos on youtube for help, but I feel that starting on a black slate and just doing what I’m having trouble with will help me. Like server side processing and implementation of code in an HTML page. I struggle with assignment1, and I’m still struggling with understanding algorithms.

3. I attempt the WODs without looking at the screencasts because that’ll take away the learning aspect for me. The first run will always be the longest run because I over complicate the direction and try other ways to get the same result. After trying various things, I do my subsequent runs to see if I can complete it without the screencast. I refer to the screencasts before I start an attempt for the WOD I’m going to turn in.

4. The labs have really helped me with being able to think through solutions and understand why things work. I get confused with some direction in the labs, but I believe that it’s due to my lack of practice and reading the manual. 

5. As of now, I am not so confident that I am ready for the next step because I struggled with assignment1 and barely got it to work properly. I refer to many videos and the tutorial links. I would say that I’m behind on learning what I need to learn, but I believe that I can get through the next assignment at a very basic level. 

6. I think that simple, in-depth explanation videos with follow along coding would help me get a firmer grasp on things like node and server side things will help. I try to find resources on youtube, like freeCodeCamp and others, for explanations, but they tend to explain things that get a little complicated to understand. 

7. The screencasts really help with my learning because I’m not fully paying attention in the morning. After the class, I can review the screencasts on parts that I didn’t understand and take my time to try the code and do different things with it to see how it would respond.
