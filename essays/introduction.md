My name is Alvin Almira, and I am a curious person. I am an undergraduate majoring in Accounting. 

Why am I taking an MIS course if I am not an MIS major or double major? I'm taking ITM352 to dip my brain into the realm of coding and understanding technology on a level deeper than a regular consumer. Technology is evolving every year, and I want to know the behind the scenes that runs technology. Understanding how technology works will be an important skill for the generations to come, so I might as well get comfortable. 

As a kid, I would always carry my gameboy advanced wherever I went. I would be playing Pokemon day-in and day-out. After the gameboy, I got a Nintendo DS and played Pokemon day-in and day-out. A couple years later, I got the Playstation Portable and played Tekken 6 day-in and day-out. Then, I got my first Apple product â€“ the 2nd generation iPod touch. From that point on, I became much more fond of technology. I started binging the tech side of youtube to get the latest information on what devices will be coming to the market. Somewhere along that timeline, I discovered jailbreaking. Diving into jailbreaking as a 10 year old, I was in awe learning about cool "tweaks" that I can download to make my device an absolute unit. For example, the first iteration of the notification center or widgets on an Apple device. These tweaks were years ahead of what the current Apple iOS has to date. But eventually, I accidentally bricked my device because I updated too many tweaks at one time. Nonetheless, things like these tweaks are what drew me into finding technology as amazing.

But, I never took the first steps into coding until this year. 

By taking ITM352, I am taking my first steps towards learning what goes into making software. There are a lot of things that I do not know. But by the end of this semester after all the struggles and countless hours staring at my screen, I would want know much more than the basics. I want to be able to make technology work for me the way I want it to. 

- Side note: I want to be able to grow old and school my grand children in the realms of technology. -
