In this<a href=https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html>Technical Essay</a> I will be talking about how I feel about my performance for <a href=https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html>WOD Invoice1</a>. 

Before I started on Invoice1, I reviewed the directions, the readings, and exercises in lab6. When I started my first attempted, I took my time with it. I wrote the scripts and made sure the syntax was correct. When it came to adding the html to the document, I completely forgot how to put data in the table. I referred to a lab6 exercise for the table. I pasted the code into invoice1 and tried everything that I thought would fix the blank html page in front of me. It took 40 minutes before the html document had some working pieces of code. I stopped my timer and started referring to html videos on youtube  and W3schoolâ€”on their table elements. After making various edits to my code, I referred to the WOD example video to see what I was missing. After seeing that I had a somewhat right idea of how to input the code into the table, I reviewed the WOD instruction and made connection to the video for the html parts that I missed. I deleted my Invoice1 folder after I reviewed my mistakes and making edits to see the final result. I started my second attempt and finished the WOD with an Average time.

All in all, I'd say that the one thing that was slowing me down was manually changing the numbers for variables after copy-pasting. 
 

For me, I need to manage my time throughout the week to make time for coding practice. I do the W3schools practice modules and reread the articles to keep code fresh. But, I don't do any small side projects to test out what I could do different and what I can do to be more proficient. Before the next WOD, I'll rerun through the WODs so I can refresh what works and what doesn't.
